# uniteAllTextFilesInOne
This script generates identic files with different names according a list provided by the user. It also creates a directory called 'result/', where it will place the files just created.

INSTRUCTIONS
Put the .pdf file, the samples txt list and the script at same directory, and just execute the script.

EXAMPLE:

sampleList.txt
'Raspberry
 Strawberry
 Blueberry'

After run, the script will generates, in this case, three identical files ((inside the directory 'result/'), with different names:
Raspberry.pdf
Strawberry.pdf
Blueberry.pdf
